This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Welcome to my portfolio and personal website!
My name is Julian Coronado, owner and creator of [jcoronado.dev](https://jcoronado.dev).
I'm an apsiring Product Manager / Software Engineer with big goals and only some experience.

This project is how I am practicing the skills I've learned in school and adding to my experience.

There isn't much yet as I am still learning how to use the React framework, but I am learning a lot!

Let me know if you have any suggestions or contributions.
